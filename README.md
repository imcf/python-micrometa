## Microscopy Metadata processing

A Python package to process metadata from various light-microscopy related data
formats. Supports generating [ImageJ][1] macros for stitching mosaics / tilings.
Developed and provided by the [Imaging Core Facility (IMCF)][imcf] of the
Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland.

The code is pure Python and known to work with CPython and Jython, so the
package can also be imported in [ImageJ Jython scripts][2].

## Packaging

The package is intended to be available in two flavours, as a mavenized version
(packaged as a jar) to be used in [ImageJ][1], as well as a "pure" Python
package to be provided through [PyPI][3].
